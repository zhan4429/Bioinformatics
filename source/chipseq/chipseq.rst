ChIP-seq
==============================
ChIP-seq identifies the locations in the genome bound by proteins. 

Sequencing steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
- The first thing we do is use formaldehyde (or something like it) to glue all of the proteins bound the DNA together with the DNA. This means that all of the DNA bound proteins, including ones we're not interested in, are glued to the DNA.
- The next thing is to cut the DNA up into small(approximately 300bp) fragments.
- Then we isolate the protein we're interested in using an antibody. 
- Then we isolate the proteins bound by the antibody and wash everything else way. 
- Reverse the formaldehyde glue by warming up everything
- Isolate the DNA by washing the proteins.
