GSEA
==============================
Identifies sets of genes that are enriched in a particular dataset when compared with a control. 
Unlike Gene Ontology, it does not consider only the subset of genes with significant changes in gene expression, as these can be highly variable between experiments.
Instead, it considers the changes in gene expression of all genes in the dataset.
